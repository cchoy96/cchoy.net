Hello World! My name is Christopher Choy and I'm a third-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).
<br> <br>
My coursework so far has focused on low-level programming and developing my proficiency in C. On my own time, I've been focusing on developing my front-end programming skills as well.
