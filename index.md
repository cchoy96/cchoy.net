Hello World! My name is Christopher Choy and I'm a third-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). As a young, bright-eyed undergradutate, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I consider myself to be a well-rounded individual that can operate well in a variety of environments. I believe my strongest points to be my organization and self-motivation. Previous employers and coworkers have praised my hardworking attitude and amicable nature.

<br>

My coursework so far has focused on low-level programming and developing my proficiency in C. And in my spare time, I've been focusing on developing my front-end programming skills as well.
