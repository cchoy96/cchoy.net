Hello World! My name is Christopher Choy. I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major
at *[The University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu)*.  
<br>
I consider myself to be a well-rounded undergraduate student and developing young professional. My professional passions are for data science, software engineering, and human-computer interactions. And my greatest strengths are my dependability, organization, and amicable nature. I aim to make a positive impact in people's lives, and I believe in leveraging today's technology to do just that.  
<br>
My coursework has given me a strong understanding of low-level computer science concepts. And my experiences through my academic, personal, and professional projects have given me an awareness for user needs and team collaboration. Though I am relatively new to the industry, I look forward to exploring and learning about all of the various fields within.
