Hello World! My name is Christopher Choy. I'm a third-year Computer Science major
at the *[University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu)*.  
<br>
I consider myself to be a well-rounded individual that can operate well in a variety of environments. I believe my strongest points to be my organization and self-motivation. Previous employers and coworkers have praised my hardworking attitude and amicable nature.  
<br>
My coursework so far has focused on low-level programming and developing my proficiency in C. In my spare time, I've been focusing on developing my front-end skills as well. Though I am relatively new to the industry, I look forward to exploring and learning about all of the various fields within.
