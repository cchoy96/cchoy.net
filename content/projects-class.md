The following are all projects that I have completed as coursework at the
University of Chicago. Per the University's Academic policies, I cannot publicly
post the code I have written for these projects, nor can I share it privately
without my professors' explicit consent. If you would like to see the actual code I've
written for these projects, please feel free to reach out to me and I will try
to obtain my professors' consent! \

That said, I am more than free to talk about these projects at a higher-level. \
