Christopher Choy was born in Rehoboth Beach, DE. <br>
I do things.  <br>

Within my community, I try to play an active and fulfilling role. <br>

Within my campus dormitory, I am the House President for the University of Chicago's [Shorey House](http://housing.uchicago.edu/houses_houses/international_house/shorey_house/). Here, I have been able to further polish my **leadership** skills as I aim to foster a comfortable home and tightly-knit community for over 50 students. <br>

In the university student-run organization [FEMMES](http://femmes.io/index.html), I lead the modules committee where we collaborate to design enjoyable, comprehensive classes for our annual capstone event. These classes aim to nurture middle-school girls from the nearby communities into developing an understanding and love for key computer science concepts. <br>

During the school year, I work at the University of Chicago's Computer Science Instructional Laboratory, [CSIL](https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/). Here, I work to maintain easy and reliable access to lab machines and university course software for thousands of students. Working here has helped me to gain experience in computer **imaging**, lab **statistics**, machine **backups**, and **website maintenence** in a dynamic environment. <br>
